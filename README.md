# Nex-portfolio

My first project while studying with _nology. 
This project introduced BEM naming conventions, scss expanding on css fundamentals and screen responsiveness. 
Whilst very rudimentary my portfolio contains brief introduction and a tidbit of information about myself. Along with some of the projects I have worked on and the skills developed over the course with _nology and thereafter.
